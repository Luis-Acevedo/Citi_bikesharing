# Market Comparison for New Business Model
Before opening a business it is important to conduct research on market data. The client in this case is looking to start a bike rides share service. To look at a comparable business market to De Moines in this instance we are looking at Citi Bikes in New York.

# In Depth Analysis

- How many trips were recorded in August? There were just over 2.3 million rides on August with 81% of riders being annual members.

- What are peak riding times? Peak riding times are between between 5pm and 7pm. Between 2am and 5 am is the slowest and perfect for performing maintenance.

- Where are peak pick up and drop off locations? This will help us save time and increase earnings potential by allowing us to know where to place and pick up most bikes. 

- What type of riders do we have? Looking at our gender breakdown we can see that mostly men ride bikes at almost a 3 to 1 ratio with women. Looking at age we can see that our younger riders tend to have a higher average ride duration. 

- Who rides our bikes more subscribers or customers? Checking to see if the business is sustainable is essential and it looks like we have a strong subscriber base which is good for the longevity of the business. 

- Which bikes are used the most frequently? This will help identify which bikes need to be maintenance more frequently to ensure bike fleet stays in working order.

# Bike Sharing Possibilities
With the data present we can see that bike sharing looks like a solid investment. Younger people seem to enjoy riding for longer durations of time than older people. And peak times tend to be in the evening with slower periods in the late hours of the night. Men seem to be the biggest set of customers outnumbering women at almost a 3:1 ratio. And the most active customers being the loyal subscribers. Alternately average trip distance should be looked at. This would give us a rough fence for when we plan out what areas we would like to offer our services in. As well as a breakdown of how gender with the subscribers. This will allow us to make better promotions for targeting specific groups.
